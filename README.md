# SG2. Multilayers/ML & methods list

A curated list of awesome places to learn and practice machine learning and graph-based methods presented at the SG2 meetings

Please refer to the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/orgs/bsc-life/teams/sg2-multilayers-ml-methods/discussions/1) when preparing your presentation.

## Methods
