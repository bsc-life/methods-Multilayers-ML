# SG2. Multilayers/ML & methods list

A curated list of awesome places to learn and practice machine learning and graph-based methods presented at the SG2 meetings

Please refer to the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/orgs/bsc-life/teams/sg2-multilayers-ml-methods/discussions/1) when preparing your presentation.

## Methods

*Implementations and presentations of machine learning and graph-based methods*

* **GenOtype PHenotype ExplOrer (GOPHER)** - Statistical inference of associations between HPO and GO terms
    * paper: [Josep-Fabregó et al. 2020](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-59851-8_13)
    * repository: [GitLab](https://pm.bsc.es/gitlab/applications/gopher)
    * presentation: [18.11.2020](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lE_FVOevaqxiKE5vQut1t2mMn7JIEF5Eox3JBpijbqw/edit?usp=sharing)
    * example: [Running GOPHER on MareNostrum](https://github.com/cirillodavide/gopher_usecase/blob/master/example_run.md)

## Suggestions

*Methods that would be nice to be presented during our meetings*

* Similarity Network Fusion (SNF)
* Matrix factorization methods (Singular Value decomposition (SVD), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF), etc.)
* [COSIFER](https://sysbio.uk-south.containers.mybluemix.net/cosifer/)
* Network comparison through graphlets
